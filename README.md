# Strong Random Password Generator
<p>
A random password generator is software program or hardware device that takes input from a random or pseudo-random number generator and automatically generates a password.
Random passwords can be generated manually, using simple sources of randomness such as dice or coins, or they can be generated using a computer.

While there are many examples of "random" password generator programs available on the Internet, generating randomness can be tricky and many programs do not generate random characters in a way that ensures strong security.
A common recommendation is to use open source security tools where possible since they allow independent checks on the quality of the methods used.

Note that simply generating a password at random does not ensure the password is a strong password, because it is possible, although highly unlikely, to generate an easily guessed or cracked password.
In fact, there is no need at all for a password to have been produced by a perfectly random process: it just needs to be sufficiently difficult to guess.
